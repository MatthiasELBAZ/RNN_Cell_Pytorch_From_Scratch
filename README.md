# RNN_Cell_Pytorch_From_Scratch
implementation  from scratch of a RNN cell with the same functionalities of  the built-in RNN cell of Pytorch.


Welcome to the Exploration of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Using PyTorch

This Jupyter notebook focuses on the world of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their implementation using the PyTorch library. RNNs are instrumental in processing sequential data, and their applications span across language modeling, time series analysis, and more. PyTorch offers a robust platform for implementing and experimenting with RNNs.

Understanding PyTorch's Built-in RNN Cell: Utilize the torch.nn.RNN module to create a baseline RNN model.
Building a Custom RNN Cell: Develop an RNN cell from scratch to deepen the understanding of RNN mechanics and recurrent neural processing.

Compare and contrast the built-in RNN cell with a custom-built one.
Explore key aspects and nuances of RNNs through hands-on implementation.

This introduction sets the stage for a deeper dive into the practical aspects and nuances of working with RNNs in PyTorch. The presentation will cover key code snippets, explain fundamental concepts, and showcase any results or visualizations contained in the notebook.


Key Concepts and Code Examples
Understanding the Sizes of Output and Hidden State Tensors

Objective: To ensure that the sizes of the output and hidden states tensors from the custom-built RNN cell match those from the built-in PyTorch RNN cell.

Approach: Experiment with different sizes and parameters to validate the implementation.
Building an RNN from Scratch

Fundamentals of RNN Cell: The goal is to build an RNN cell from the foundation, understanding each component's role in processing the input and maintaining the hidden state.
