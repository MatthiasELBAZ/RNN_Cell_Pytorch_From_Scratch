    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this Jupyter notebook, where we delve into the fascinating world of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using PyTorch. RNNs are a class of neural networks that are pivotal in processing sequential data, making them crucial for tasks like language modeling, time series analysis, and more. PyTorch, being a powerful and flexible deep learning library, provides efficient implementations of RNNs, allowing for rapid prototyping and experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective of This Notebook**\n",
    "The primary objective of this notebook is to learn about RNN cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PyTorch's Built-in RNN Cell: We will use PyTorch's torch.nn.RNN module to create an RNN instance. This serves as our baseline model, representing the standard implementation in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Custom-Built RNN Cell: We will construct our own RNN cell from scratch. This exercise is aimed at gaining deeper insights into the mechanics of RNNs and understanding the nuances of recurrent neural processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Aspects of Comparison**\n",
    "Our comparison will focus on the following aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Output Dimensions: Ensuring that both models yield outputs with consistent dimensions is crucial. This includes testing across various scenarios:\n",
    "    - Input without batch dimension\n",
    "    - Input with batch dimension\n",
    "    - Variations when the batch dimension is either the first or second axis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Outcomes**\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we aim to achieve a comprehensive understanding of:\n",
    "- The architecture and functionality of RNN cells\n",
    "- How PyTorch implements RNNs and manages data dimensions\n",

    "# Pytorch Built-in RNN Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to present the architecture of a RNN cell from PyTorch. If we look at the documentation of PyTorch RNN cell (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.RNN.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The PyTorch RNN cell implements a multi-layer Elman RNN, which can use either a tanh or ReLU activation function. The core behavior of an RNN cell is described by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h_{t} = tanh(x_{t}*W_{ih}^T + b_{ih} + h_{t-1}*W_{hh}^T + b_{hh}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation encapsulates the essence of the RNN's recurrent nature. It combines two linear transformations - one applied to the current input $x_{t}$ and the other to the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The weights $W_{ih}$ and $W_{hh}$ represent the input-to-hidden and hidden-to-hidden connections, respectively, while $b_{ih}$ and $b_{hh}$ are their corresponding biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process can be broken into steps:\n",
    "- Initialize\n",
    "    - $h = 0$\n",
    "- For each time step $t$ in  the sequence:\n",
    "    - $x = x_{t}*W_{ih}^T + b_{ih}$\n",
    "    - $h = h_{t-1}*W_{hh}^T + b_{hh}$\n",
    "    - $c = x + h$\n",
    "    - $h_{t} = tanh(c)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, this equation describes how an RNN cell combines the current input with the previous hidden state to generate the current hidden state to concatenante with the next input. This process is repeated across each time step in the input sequence, allowing the RNN to maintain a form of 'memory' of past inputs. This memory is crucial for tasks where context and sequence order are important, such as language modeling, speech recognition, and time series analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the documentation of Pytorch's RNN cell, we need to respect the folowing sizes:\n",
    "- *S*: Sequence Length - the number of time steps in the input.\n",
    "- *I*: Input Size - the dimension of the input vector at each time step.\n",
    "- *H*: Hidden Size - the size of the hidden state vector, a key parameter indicating the network's memory capacity.\n",
    "- *B*: Batch Size - the number of sequences processed simultaneously.\n",
    "- *L*: Number of Layers - layers in the RNN.\n",
    "- *D*: Direction - 2 for bidirectional RNNs (forward and backward), else 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inputs**\n",
    "    - input $x_{t}$\n",
    "        - Unbatched (S, I)\n",
    "        - Batched   (S, B, I) or (B,S,I)\n",
    "    - hidden $h_{t-1}$\n",
    "        - Unbatched (DL, H) \n",
    "        - Batched   (DL, B, H) or (B, DL, H)\n",
    "- **Outputs**\n",
    "    - output $o_{t}$\n",
    "        - Unbatched (S, DH)\n",
    "        - Batched   (S, B, DH) or (B, S, DH) \n",
    "    - hidden $h_{t}$\n",
    "        - Unbatched (DL, H) \n",
    "        - Batched   (DL, B, H) or (B, DL, H)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Dimensions (S, D*H): The output of an RNN cell is not directly the final prediction (e.g., a class or a word) but rather the representation of the sequence after processing through the RNN layers. Each time step outputs a vector of size DH, which can be further processed or used as input to another layer or network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RNNs, the terms \"hidden state\" and \"output\" are often used interchangeably, but they can have different meanings depending on context:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hidden State $h_{t}$: Represents the memory of the network, carrying information across time steps. It's updated at each time step based on the current input and the previous hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output $o_{t}$: While the hidden state is the RNN's internal memory, the output at each time step can be a transformed version of this hidden state, tailored for specific tasks. For example, in many applications, a linear layer followed by an activation function is applied to the hidden state to produce the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing to say is the possibility to set the batch dimension at first or second place. It depends on the convenience, how does it integrated, preferences.\n"
